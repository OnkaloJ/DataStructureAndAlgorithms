Assignment 1.1: Insertion Sort (3 points)
Following pseudo code sorts an array of integers. Command swap switches values of two variables.

function isort(A)
    for i = 1 to size(A)-1
        j = i-1
        while (j >= 0) and (A[j] > A[j+1])
            swap(A[j], A[j+1])
            j = j-1
Create the following function in Python:

isort(A: list): sorts a given list of integers using the insertion sort. Implement function based on the above pseudo code. Note that the use of the Python's built-in sort() method is not allowed.
Limits (your code should work with an input that is within these limits):

the maximum length of the list is 103
each integer is between 1â€¦103
A code template with an example program:

def isort(A):
    # TODO


if __name__ == "__main__": 
    A = [4, 3, 6, 2, 9, 7, 1, 8, 5]
    isort(A)
    print(A)
Output:

$ python isort.py
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
