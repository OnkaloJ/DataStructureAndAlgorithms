Assignment 1.2 Prime Numbers (3 points)
For the background read the first paragraph of this article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number

Given a number N
 how many prime numbers are less or equal to N
? For example if N=7
 there are four prime numbers: 2
, 3
, 5
 and 7
 (note that 1 is not a prime number).

Create the following function in Python:

primes(N: int): returns the numbers of primes that are less or equal to N
Limits: 1≤N≤105

A code template with an example program:

def primes(N):
    # TODO


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(primes(7))
    print(primes(15))
    print(primes(50))
Output:

$ python primes.py
4
6
15
