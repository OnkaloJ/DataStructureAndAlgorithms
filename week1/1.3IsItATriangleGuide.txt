Assignment 1.3: Is it a Triangle? (3 points)
Three integers a
, b
 and c
 presents the side lenghts of a triangle. Can you build any triangle from those three sides?

For example:

sides 3
, 4
 and 5
 makes a right angle triangle
sides 5
, 5
 and 3
 makes an isosceles triangle
sides 7
, 3
 and 3
 doesn't make a triangle
sides 4
, 3
 and âˆ’1
 doesn't make a triangle
Create the following function in Python:

triangle(a: int, b: int, c: int): returns a boolean True if triangle can be built, False if not
A code template with an example program:

def triangle(a, b, c):
    # TODO


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(triangle(3, 5, 4))
    print(triangle(-1, 2, 3))
    print(triangle(5, 9, 14))
    print(triangle(30, 12, 29))
Output:

$ python triangle.py
True
False
False
True
